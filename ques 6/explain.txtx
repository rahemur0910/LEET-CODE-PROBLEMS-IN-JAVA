We create an array of StringBuilder objects to represent each row of the zigzag pattern. Each row will contain characters that fall into that row when traversing the zigzag.

We initialize a variable row to keep track of the current row while traversing the input string. We also have a boolean variable goingDown to indicate whether we are currently moving down or up in the zigzag pattern.

We iterate through each character of the input string and append it to the corresponding row in the array of StringBuilders.

When we reach the top row (row == 0) or the bottom row (row == numRows - 1), we change the direction (goingDown) to reverse the movement in the zigzag pattern.

Finally, we concatenate all the rows in the array of StringBuilders to get the final zigzag pattern string and return it.

The main method demonstrates how to use this function with a given input string and number of rows.
