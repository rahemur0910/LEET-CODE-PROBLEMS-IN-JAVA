We have a reverse method that takes an integer x as input and returns the integer with its digits reversed. Inside the method, we use a while loop to process each digit of the input integer.

We extract the last digit of x using the modulus operator and add it to the reversed variable after multiplying reversed by 10 to shift its digits to the left.

Before adding the new digit, we check if it will cause an overflow or underflow. If adding the digit would make the reversed integer exceed the 32-bit signed integer range, we return 0 to indicate overflow or underflow.

In the main method, we use a Scanner object to take user input for a signed 32-bit integer.

We call the reverse method with the user input integer and print the reversed integer to the console.
