Here's how we can approach it:

Create a mapping of digits to letters according to the telephone buttons.
Define a recursive function to generate combinations for each digit in the input string.
Start with an empty string and add letters corresponding to the first digit.
Recursively call the function for the next digit, appending letters to the current combination.
Repeat this process until all digits have been processed.
Store each valid combination during the recursion.
Return all stored combinations.
