Class Definition:

    The solution is encapsulated within a class named Solution.
Method Signature:

The findMedianSortedArrays method signature:
It takes two sorted integer arrays nums1 and nums2 as input. 
It returns a double value, representing the median of the two arrays.
Initialization:

m and n are initialized to the lengths of nums1 and nums2, respectively.
minIndex is initialized to 0, representing the minimum index for binary search.
maxIndex is initialized to m, representing the maximum index for binary search.
halfLength is calculated as (m + n + 1) / 2, representing the midpoint of the merged array.
Binary Search:

The solution uses binary search to find the correct partitioning point in the smaller array (nums1).
Inside the while loop, i is calculated as the midpoint between minIndex and maxIndex, and j is calculated based on halfLength.
Depending on the comparisons between elements from nums1 and nums2, the value of i is adjusted to find the correct partition point.
Partitioning and Median Calculation:

Once the correct partition point is found, the maximum value of the left partition (maxLeft) and the minimum value of the right partition (minRight) are calculated.
If the total number of elements in the merged array is odd, the median is simply the maxLeft.
If the total number of elements is even, the median is calculated as the average of maxLeft and minRight.
Main Method:

The main method serves as an entry point to the program.
It creates an instance of the Solution class and tests the findMedianSortedArrays method with sample input arrays.
It prints out the calculated median values.
Edge Cases Handling:

The solution handles cases where one array is larger than the other by swapping the arrays to ensure nums1 represents the smaller array.
It also handles cases where the total number of elements in the merged array is odd or even to calculate the median accordingly.
Complexity:

The overall time complexity of the solution is O(log(min(m, n))), where m and n are the lengths of the input arrays. This meets the requirement of O(log (m+n)) when considering the total number of elements in both arrays.
