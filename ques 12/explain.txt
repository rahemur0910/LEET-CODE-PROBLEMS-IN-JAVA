Input: The program takes an integer input from the user.

Conversion to Roman Numeral:

The program uses a series of predefined arrays to map integer values to their corresponding Roman numeral symbols.
Two arrays are used: one for integer values (values) and the other for corresponding Roman numeral symbols (symbols).
The program iterates through these arrays and constructs the Roman numeral representation by repeatedly appending the appropriate symbols based on the integer input.
It starts with the largest value from the values array and repeatedly subtracts it from the input integer until the input becomes 0.
While subtracting, the program appends the corresponding symbol to the Roman numeral representation.
Output: After constructing the Roman numeral representation, the program returns or displays it.

Validation: Depending on the specific requirements, the program may include validation to ensure that the input integer is within the range supported by Roman numerals (typically 1 to 3999). If the input is not within this range, the program may display an error message.

Main Method (if applicable): In a modular design, the conversion logic may be encapsulated in a method (e.g., intToRoman) separate from the main program logic. The main method is responsible for handling user input, calling the conversion method, and displaying the result.
