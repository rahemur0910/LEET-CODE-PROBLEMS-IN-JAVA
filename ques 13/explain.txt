We create a HashMap named romanValues to store the values of Roman numerals.
We iterate through the Roman numeral string.
For each numeral, we retrieve its value from the romanValues HashMap.
If the current numeral's value is less than the next one, we subtract its value from the total (and account for the subtraction case).
Otherwise, we add its value to the total.
Finally, we return the total value, which represents the integer equivalent of the Roman numeral.
