Here's the algorithm:

Sort the array nums in non-decreasing order.
Initialize a variable closestSum to store the closest sum found so far. Initialize it with a value that's large enough to ensure it gets updated on the first iteration.
Iterate through the array nums using a pointer i from 0 to n-3:
Within this loop, initialize two pointers, left at i + 1 and right at n - 1.
While left is less than right, calculate the current sum sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right].
Check if the absolute difference between sum and target is less than the absolute difference between closestSum and target. If so, update closestSum with sum.
If sum is less than target, increment left. Otherwise, decrement right.
Return closestSum as the result.
